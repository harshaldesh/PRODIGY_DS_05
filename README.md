# Prodigy Infotech – Task 05  
## Traffic Accident Analysis (US Accidents Dataset)

## 📌 Objective
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to **time of day, weather conditions, and road infrastructure**, and visualize **accident hotspots and contributing factors**.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** US Accidents (March 2023)
- **Source:** Kaggle – US Accidents Dataset
- **Description:** The dataset contains traffic accident records across the United States, including time, location, weather conditions, and road features.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation
Minimal preprocessing was performed to support accurate analysis and visualization:
- Converted accident start time to datetime format
- Handled missing values only in critical columns
- Removed non-essential columns with high missing values (End_Lat, End_Lng)
- Filled missing weather conditions with appropriate labels

---

## 📈 Analysis & Visualizations
The following analyses were performed:
- Accident trends by **hour of day**
- Comparison of **day vs night** accidents
- Impact of **weather conditions** on accidents
- Analysis of **road infrastructure features** (junctions, traffic signals, crossings)
- **Geographical visualization** to identify accident hotspots

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Accidents peak during **morning and evening commute hours**
- Junctions and traffic signals are high-risk areas
- Clear weather accounts for most accidents due to higher traffic volume
- Accident hotspots are concentrated in **urban and high-traffic regions**

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This analysis highlights how time, weather, and road conditions influence traffic accidents. The insights can support **data-driven traffic safety planning and risk reduction strategies**.
